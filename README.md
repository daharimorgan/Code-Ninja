# CompTIA A+ 4-Week Dojo Project

This is your organized workspace for the accelerated CompTIA A+ study sprint.
Use the tracker, logs, notes, and cheatsheets to guide, measure, and reflect on your progress.

Folders:
- /certifications — Project tracker and exam goals
- /weekly-logs — Weekly and daily plans/logs
- /phase-1-foundations/notes — In-depth study notes
- /phase-1-foundations/cheatsheets — Fast reference for ports, cables, and more

Update these files daily as you progress. If you want more templates or automated logging, ask your Coding Miyagi!# Coder-Dojo
